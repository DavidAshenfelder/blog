Today we learned about accessing items with-in a .json file or other files for that matter. We learned how to use functions that would allow us to access this information via calling certain elements. For instance .filter can create a new array that will have all items compiled given the specified conditions. Also, .reduce can help us by adding numbers and accumulating them with the current number 1+2=3+3=6+4=10. My favorite method of all was .map not because of it's capabilities, but because it's ability to distract me as every time Calvin would say map....My mind would wander the song "Im the Map, Im the Map, Im the Map Im the Map", would ramble through my head. If you are not familiar or, do not have kids, this is a common song sung in Dora the Explorer TV show for kids....

oh yeah, back to .map this is a valuable function that will create an array of strings. Know the difference between a String and an Object! I learned the hard way, and Calvin felt my pain as I  bombarded him with question after floundering question. Slowly but surely I began to grasp an understanding of how to manipulate information with-in a file, and return only the information wanted.

After each success there will always be another failure. I am only able to continue because I know that another success will transpire, if, and only if I do not quit.
